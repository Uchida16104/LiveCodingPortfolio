# SynthFX

I used [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/), [SonicPi](https://sonic-pi.net/), etc. to define the synths and effects that came to my mind as ideas.

## Usage

* From SuperCollider

1. Download related repositories or files.

2-1. Open `.scd`file, choose `Language` -> `Evaluate File`, and make sure of export path such as `/path/to/SynthFX`.

2-2. Open Sonic Pi, and load synths or effects by writing `load_synthdefs "/path/to/SynthFX"`.

2-3. Let's enjoy your performance!

* From Sonic Pi

1. Do 1. for the case from SuperCollider above.

2. Make sure of export path such as `/path/to/SynthFX`, and do 2-2. for the case from SuperCollider above.

3. Let's enjoy your performance!
